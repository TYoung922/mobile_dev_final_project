branches:

main - has the base app without a search function
search - has an added search function.

This is my Recipe app. Initially the user has to either sign in or create an account. Once in the user can create new recipes and view existing ones. Each recipe has options to add them to both a favorites list by clicking the star icon or adding their ingredients to the shopping list by clicking the list icon. In addition, each Recipe detail screen has an edit option to allow for editing of a given recipe. Both global app state and a firebase database are used. The firebase holds information on recipes, favorites list, and shopping lists. Both the favorites list and shopping lists are stored by users so different users can have different favorites and shopping lists.

I have added a search function that can filter through the recipes based of different search criteria, It can be found on the categories screen at the bottom.
